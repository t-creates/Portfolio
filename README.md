PORTFOLIO

Portfolio Application

This personal portfolio project was built with React.js, Styled Components, TypeScript, and Sanity. It features a clean and modern design, showcasing my work and accomplishments in web development.

### Built With

The website is built with popular web technologies, including React for building user interfaces, Styled Components for styling components with CSS, and TypeScript for improved code readability. It also utilizes Sanity for managing and delivering structured content:

- **React.js** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily composed to build complex applications.
- **Styled Components** is a library for styling React components with CSS. It allows developers to write CSS styles directly in their JavaScript code, making it easy to apply styles to individual components.
- **Sanity** is a platform for building structured content and digital experiences. It provides a powerful set of tools for creating, managing, and delivering structured content, including a flexible data schema, a rich text editor, and an API for querying and retrieving content.

### **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

****Prerequisites****

- git
    
    If you want to clone the project from GitHub and work with it locally, you will need to have Git installed on your system. You can download and install Git from the official website (**[https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)**).
    
- Node.js
    
    Application requires Node.js to be installed on your system in order to run. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website (**[https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)**).
    
- npm (Node Package Manager)
    
    npm is the package manager for Node.js, and is used to manage the dependencies and packages required for your Next.js project. It is installed automatically when you install Node.js.
    
    To check if npm is installed on your system, you can open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
    

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can proceed to clone the project from GitHub using Git.

****Installing****

Make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites installed on your system. Follow the below steps to install the setup the project on your machine:

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
- Run the following command to clone the project from GitHub:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/t-creates/portfolio.git
    ```
    
- This will create a new directory called "portfolio_rich" in the current location, containing the code for the Portfolio project.
- Navigate to the project directory by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cd portfolio
    ```
    
- Run the following command to install the project's dependencies using npm:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
- Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    This will start the development server and open the Portfolio application in your default web browser.
    
- To run the sanity, navigate to the "cms" folder in your terminal
    
    ```bash
    cd cms
    ```
    
    Run the following command to install the required dependencies
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    Run the following command to start the Sanity Studio
    
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    
    This will start the Sanity Studio, which is the web-based interface for managing and editing your project's content. The Studio will be available at **[http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333/)** in your web browser.
    

Note: If you want to set up your Sanity content platform which is used to manage and deliver structured content for the portfolio website, you have to create your own project that will provide the project ID, dataset name, and token.
